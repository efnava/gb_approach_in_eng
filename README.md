## Oil reservoir dataset

([npv-reservoir.csv](datasets/npv-reservoir.csv))

The case study corresponds to a real reservoir in the western Venezuela, whose Net Present Value (NPV) was estimated for a horizont of 20 years given different possible locations for 3 planned new producers. The dataset consist of 178 samples with input the I and J coordinate for three new producers (6 variables) and as output the simulated NPV in Bolivares [Bs.].
